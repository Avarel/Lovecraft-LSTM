# Lovecraft-LSTM

A machine learning (Tensorflow) program that generates Lovecraftian horrors for your horror obsession with the old gods, who will remake this world in their image when they awake from their slumber. Based on [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-text-with-tensorflow-2-0-6a65c7bdc568) on LSTMs.

# Running the Code
## Local Machine
* One day, I'll get a GPU strong enough that I can actually do this, but not today.

## Google Colaboratory
* Upload the training and validation text files.
    * Compress the contents of the folders into a `.zip` and extract using the following command on the kernel.
        * `!unzip -o "./data.zip" -d "./"`
* Set up the journal to use the correct Tensorflow version and beg the Google lords to allow you to use their **Nvidia Tesla P100** GPUs.
    * Add the following into the kernel:
         ```python
            try:
                %tensorflow_version 2.x
            except Exception:
                pass
            !pip install tensorflow-gpu```
* Copy the code from `./main.py` over to a code block.
* Run the code block first, this is very important so the journal is set up with the right code.
* Run `generate()`.

# Sample
Here's a sample so far! Nothing interesting though. Need to feed more data into the model.
